\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Most large scale software companies (hyperscalers) are reliant on consensus algorithms to control at least some part of their critical infrastructure.
As a result of this, there is warranted motivation to find ways to adapt traditional consensus algorithms to the changing landscape of networks and systems found in practice.
By far the two most common consensus algorithms applied in these domains are Raft \cite{10.5555/2643634.2643666} and Paxos \cite{lamport_1998}.
For this project, we  try to reason about some variants of the Raft consensus protocol that we deemed favorable over the original protocol for certain fault scenarios that may be encountered in practice such as network partitioning and crash-faults with recovery.
