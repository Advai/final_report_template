    Distributed consensus is required for many modern day applications such as replicated state machines, distributed file systems, and databases. 
    However traditional consensus algorithms have been developed in research for simplicity and understandability. 
    We find that certain design decisions can be made to improve the performance of consensus algorithms by expanding the model of fault-tolerances to be more applicable to the faults experienced in practice. 
    In this paper we describe two variations of Raft intended  for better performance under specific, understudied fault models such as network partitions, and fail-stop restart faults.
