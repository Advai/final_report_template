    Distributed consensus is required for many modern day applications such as replicated state machines, distributed file systems, and databases. 
    However traditional consensus algorithm research has to make fine-grained assumptions about fault behavior. have been developed in research for simplicity and understandability. 
    We propose that more specialized design decisions can be made to improve the performance of consensus algorithms by expanding the model of fault-tolerances to be more applicable to the faults experienced in practice. 
    In this paper we describe two optimizations of Raft that we call Flexible Chained Raft intended for better performance under specific, understudied fault models such as network partitions, and fail-slow faults.
